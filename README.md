## 📋 Who we are

**GEOCHEM** is a research project focused on the study of the impact of climate change in Antarctica using different techniques, such as: geochemistry, remote sensing, geophysics... 

## 🎯 Main objectives 

- 🧪 Geochemical analysis
- 🛰️ Monitoring through remote sensing
- 🔄 Establishing correlations between our data and climate changes

## 👥 Our team

Our team is composed of geologists, chemists, remote sensing experts and data scientists, all dedicated to polar research and its environmental implications.

### Principal researches

| Researcher | Field of study |
